    Although most of the Stack Overflow answerers are aware that their code can be outdated, 51.5% of the answerers were very rarely notified and 35.5% have never been notified of outdated code in the answers. After being notified, 19.8% of them rarely or never fix the outdated code. 124 answerers out of 200 (62%) are aware of Stack Overflow’s CC BY-SA 3.0 license applied to code snippets in questions and answers. However, only 3 answerers explicitly include software license in their answers. Some answerers choose to include the license in their profile page instead. 69% of the answerers never check for licensing conflicts between their copied code snippets and Stack Overflow’s CC BY-SA 3.0.

    We found 153 pairs with strong evidences to be cloned from 23 Qualitas projects to Stack Overflow, 1 pair was cloned from Stack Overflow to Qualitas, and 109 pairs were found to be cloned to Stack Overflow from external sources. However, the largest amount of the clone pairs between Stack Overflow and Qualitas projects are boiler-plate code (216), followed by 65 clone pairs with no evidence that the code has actually been copied, and 9 pairs of clones due to implementing the same interface or inheriting the same class.

    Our results show that 66% (101) of QS clone pairs on Stack Overflow are outdated. 86 pairs differ from their newest versions by modifications applied to variable names or method names, added or deleted statements, to a fully rewritten code with new method signatures. 15 pairs are dead snippets. 47 outdated code snippets are found in 130,703 GitHub projects without evidence of copying, which of 12 were buggy. A toxic code snippet with a race condition was found in two popular projects: deeplearning4j and Apache Hive.

    We found 214 code snippets on Stack Overflow that could potentially violate the license of their original software. The majority of them do not contain licensing statements after they have been copied to Stack Overflow. For 164 of them, we were able to identify, with evidence, where the code snippet has been copied from. We found occurrences of 7,112 clones of the 214 license-incompatible code snippets in 2,427 GitHub projects.
