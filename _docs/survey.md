title: Stack Overflow User Survey
permalink: /docs/survey/
---

We support our findings of
toxic code snippets on Stack Overflow by asking Stack
Overflow users to take an online survey. The survey was used for assessing awareness of
the developers on the two issues of outdated code and license-violating code
snippets.

The participants were invited to take the survey via email addresses available
on their public Stack Overflow and GitHub profiles. We selected the answerers
based on the <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/users?tab=Reputation&filter=all">all-time reputation ranking</a>. The
invited participants had a reputation from 963,731 (the highest) to 6,999 and
we sent out 607 emails (excluding undelivered ones, e.g. due to
illegal email addresses).

The survey was
open for participation for two months, from 25 July to 25 September 2017, before
we collected and analysed the responses.
