title: Stack Overflow Answerers and Visitors Survey
permalink: /docs/survey/

We support our findings of
toxic code snippets on Stack Overflow by asking Stack
Overflow users to take online surveys. The surveys were used for assessing awareness of
the developers on the two issues of outdated code and license-violating code
snippets.

There were two surveys: The Stack Overflow Answerers' Survey and Stack Overflow Visitors' survey.

### The Answerers' Survey

The participants were invited to take the survey via email addresses available
on their public [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com) and [GitHub](https://github.com)
profiles. We selected the answerers
based on the [all-time reputation ranking](https://stackoverflow.com/users?tab=Reputation&filter=all). The
invited participants had a reputation from 963,731 (the highest) to 6,999 and
we sent out 607 emails (excluding undelivered ones, e.g. due to
illegal email addresses).

The survey was
open for participation for two months, from 25 July to 25 September 2017, before
we collected and analysed the responses.

### The Visitors' Survey

We adopted non-probability convenient sampling to invite participants for this survey. Participation in the survey requires experience of visiting Stack Overflow for solving programming tasks at least once. The participants were invited to take the survey via five channels: social media post (Facebook), blognone.com (a popular technol- ogy news and media community in Thailand), the Univer- sity of Molise in Italy where the third author works, the comp.lang.java.programmer group, and the Software Engineering Facebook page. The survey was open for par- ticipation for 2 months from 25 July 2017 to 25 September 2017.

The complete survey results can be found in our [UCL CS Research Note](http://www.cs.ucl.ac.uk/fileadmin/UCL-CS/research/Research_Notes/cloverflow_survey_rn-17-10.pdf).
